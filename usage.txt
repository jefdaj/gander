The "Git ANnex DedupER" deduplicates files and folders in a git-annex repo.

Usage:
  gander (-h | --help)
  gander [-vc] -a ANNEX [-d DEDUP] (add | verify) ORIGINALS [-f FILES] [-l LINKS]
  gander [-vc] -a ANNEX [-d DEDUP] fsck [-l LINKS]
  gander [-vc] -a ANNEX gc

Options:
  -h, --help               Show this help text
  -v, --verbose            Show each step as it runs
  -c, --confirm            Prompt to confirm each step before it runs. Implies verbose.
  -a, --annex-dir ANNEX    Top level git annex directory for deduping.
  -d, --dedup-dir DEDUP    Dedup/destination directory relative to the annex. Defaults to
                           top-level. The source directory will be copied here for deduping.
                           Uses rsync notation, so `dir/` is different from `dir`.
  -f, --orig-files FILES   Load a previously-generated list of files in ORIGINALS.
                           No attempt is made to verify this list, so be sure you
                           haven't changed the ORIGINALS dir since generating it!
                           If the list doesn't exist yet, it will be created.
  -l, --dedup-links LINKS  Load a previously-generated list of the links in DEDUP.
                           No attempt is made to verify this list, so be sure you
                           haven't changed the DEDUP dir since generating it!
                           If the list doesn't exist yet, it will be created.
  ORIGINALS                The directory to act on (copy + dedup or verify).

Commands:
  add     Copies the SOURCE directory into ANNEX/DEDUP and `git annex add`s it.
  verify  Checks file names + content to make sure they have been added faithfully.
  fsck    Runs `git annex fsck` on the DEDUP dir to make sure files match their hashes.
  gc      Runs `git gc --aggressive` in the ANNEX to speed up future git operations.

Examples:

  gander -v -a /media/jeff/annex -d unsorted/mybook add "/media/jeff/WD My Book/"

  Copy the contents of "/media/jeff/WD My Book" to
  /media/jeff/annex/unsorted/mybook and annex it, deduping files in the process.
  Includes hidden files. Note that without the trailing slash the "WD My Book" folder
  would end up *inside* mybook.
