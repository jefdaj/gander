x fix the skipping mechanism
add cmdTest
  round-trip a dir through the serialization
add cmdDiff
  wait, is this actually needed?
  would be nice to have the smallest possible printed tree explaining differences
add cmdUpdate
  should it use two hashes files, or one + the actual dir to be updated?
add cmdAdd
add cmdRemove
add cmdDedup which will loop through asking to delete + updating hashes
