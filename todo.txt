better hashing:
  should be fast to verify dir hashes when reading the tree right? might prevent file editing mistakes
  should there be a third L type for symlinks?

bugs to fix:
  dir hashes need to be recalculated after changing contents (including rm)
  have to handle "permission denied" errors? maybe just abort and make user have sudo

simplify the interface:
  gander hash  <target> [-e <exclude>]
  gander dupes <target> [-e <exclude>]
  gander dedup <target> [-e <exclude>] [-fc]
  gander diff  <oldtarget> <newtarget> [-e <exclude>]
  gander test  <testdir>
  gander <annex> init
  gander <annex> hash  [<path>] [-f]
  gander <annex> dupes [<path>]
  gander <annex> dedup [<path>] [-fc]
  gander <annex> add    <path>  [-s <srcpath>] [-fc]
  gander <annex> rm     <path>  [-fc]

minor features to add if time:
  make sure dir listings are alphabetical (probably are already)
  warning when you use potentially destructive standalone commands in an annex
