would it help to break up HashTree.hs further?
put dir/file before hash and split on that to handle newlines in filenames

when listing dupes, sort paths by n components then alphabet

better interface:
  all commands start with the main hashes file
  find repo based on that and stick with it throughout
  init command to create repo + empty hashes file

asciinema demos:
  fork from master or dedup-1-compiles-but-broken?

  make a pile of duplicated files/folders
    download free music
    randomly list 2 folders in it
    copy the first into the second
    then do files into folders too?

  both demos:
    init repo with empty hashes
    add some files
    hash + list dupes separately
    dedup them

  first demo because this works already:
    want manual control to work gander into an existing workflow
    do the operations separately
    manage hash files yourself
    mix freely with git operations

  second demo that will be more for brian:
    want to use the repo specifically for deduping as simply as possible
    add a gander init command to create repo, annex init, create empty hashes.txt
