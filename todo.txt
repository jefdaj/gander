better hashing:
  should be fast to verify dir hashes when reading the tree right? might prevent file editing mistakes
  print each hash as it finished (line buffering issue?)

bugs to fix:
  dir hashes need to be recalculated after changing contents (including rm)
  "too many levels of symbolic links" when hashing system folders with cyclic symlinks
    /usr/bin/X11 seems to trigger it
    just want to hash the destination path instead of following it
  have to handle "permission denied" errors? maybe just abort and make user have sudo

simplify the interface:
  gander hash  <target> [-e <exclude>]
  gander dupes <target> [-e <exclude>]
  gander dedup <target> [-e <exclude>] [-fc]
  gander diff  <oldtarget> <newtarget> [-e <exclude>]
  gander test  <testdir>
  gander <annex> init
  gander <annex> hash  [<path>] [-f]
  gander <annex> dupes [<path>]
  gander <annex> dedup [<path>] [-fc]
  gander <annex> add    <path>  [-s <srcpath>] [-fc]
  gander <annex> rm     <path>  [-fc]

minor features to add if time:
  add hashes to the dupes output? have to adjust the types first
  when listing dupes, sort paths by n components then alphabet
  make sure dir listings are alphabetical (probably are already)
  can the format be compressed a little more by combining D and the indent? or better, can the indent be removed?
  warning when you use potentially destructive standalone commands in an annex
