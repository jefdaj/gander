remove Types.hs if possible, or convert to just Options.hs
would it help to break up HashTree.hs further?
are the fancier modules needed? might be able to do fine without dedup, delete, import
does Dupes get made from a Tree or Stream/List directly?
do Stream/Lists get made from Trees too?
should Add be called Move?
don't need explicit tests; the test is round-tripping our actual filenames + files
