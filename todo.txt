hey, it should be relatively easy to remove subfolders from the dupes list! try that next
also add hashes to the output

would it help to break up HashTree.hs further?
put dir/file before hash and split on that to handle newlines in filenames

when listing dupes, sort paths by n components then alphabet

better interface:
  all commands start with the main hashes file
  find repo based on that and stick with it throughout
  init command to create repo + empty hashes file

asciinema demos:
  fork from master or dedup-1-compiles-but-broken?
  first demo because this works already:
    want manual control to work gander into an existing workflow
    do the operations separately
    manage hash files yourself
    mix freely with git operations
  second demo that will be more for brian:
    want to use the repo specifically for deduping as simply as possible
    add a gander init command to create repo, annex init, create empty hashes.txt

everything as edits:
  make an Edit datatype... or Delta? that describes change in a hashtree
  it can start as the same one used for Diff now
  but should include everything needed to say beforehand whether a given list of changes is safe too
  later you can test that for any edit the precalculated delta == actual scan at the end

does diff actually work enough for testing already?
  only important to go from delta -> new hashes, not new hashes -> delta so much
  because can do the git operation and re-hash everything to test that!
