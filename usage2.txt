New usage is split into annex and standalone (no-annex) modes.
No-annex ones are roughly unix-style.
Annex ones are interactive and make the user confirm everything.
You can hash annexed files in standalone non-annex style too.
None of the standalone ones are destructive.
For now, only the annex-style rm and update change anything (move later).
Update is replaced by re-running hash when the hashes already exist.
Delete is renamed to rm.
Annex is renamed add and the src/dst are flipped so it works with src in the annex too.
Backup (save?) will make a timestamped copy of the annex hashes file.
For simplicity, all repeatable args removed from annex style for now?
Should the annex commands all take a (Maybe FilePath) for the annex? Or use cfg?

First step is to make all the annex-mode ones confirm what they're going to do.
... err, very first step is to get docopt to read the new usage.

annex:
  gander <annex> [-vf] hash  [<path>] [-e <exclude>]
  gander <annex> [-v ] fsck  [<path>]
  gander <annex> [-v ] dupes [<path>]
  gander <annex> [-v ] dedup [<path>]
  gander <annex> [-vf] add    <path>  [-s <src>]
  gander <annex> [-vf] rm     <path>
  gander <annex> [-v ] save

standalone:
  gander [-v] hash  <path>... [-e <exclude>]
  gander [-v] diff  <old> <new>
  gander [-v] fsck  <hashes> [<path>...]
  gander [-v] dupes <hashes> [<path>...]
  gander [-v] dedup <hashes> [<path>...]

test:
  gander [-v] test <path>
